- **Hardware Acceleration**: Improved performance
- **Network Optimization**: Intelligent buffering and caching

### When VLC Player Activates
- ‚úÖ On Android, iOS, macOS when toggle is ON
- ‚úÖ Automatically optimized for HLS streams
- ‚úÖ Falls back to standard player if VLC fails to initialize

### When Standard Player is Used
- üåê Always on Web platforms
- üì± When VLC toggle is OFF
- üîÑ As fallback if VLC encounters issues

## üõ†Ô∏è VLC Configuration

The app configures VLC with optimized settings:

```dart
VlcPlayerOptions(
  // Advanced caching for smooth playback
  advanced: VlcAdvancedOptions([
    VlcAdvancedOptions.networkCaching(2000),  // 2 second buffer
    VlcAdvancedOptions.clockJitter(0),        // Reduce jitter
  ]),
  
  // Video optimization
  video: VlcVideoOptions([
    VlcVideoOptions.dropLateFrames(true),     // Skip delayed frames
    VlcVideoOptions.skipFrames(true),         // Skip when needed
  ]),
  
  // Stream output optimization
  sout: VlcStreamOutputOptions([
    VlcStreamOutputOptions.soutMuxCaching(2000),
  ]),
  
  // RTP streaming support
  rtp: VlcRtpOptions([
    VlcRtpOptions.rtpOverRtsp(true),
  ]),
)
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### VLC Player Not Working?
1. **Check Platform**: VLC only works on mobile/desktop, not web
2. **Toggle Switch**: Make sure VLC toggle is ON
3. **Restart App**: Sometimes initialization requires a restart
4. **Try Standard Player**: Use the toggle to switch to standard player
5. **Check URL**: Ensure the stream URL is valid and accessible

### Performance Issues?
1. **Hardware Acceleration**: VLC automatically enables hardware acceleration
2. **Network Caching**: Default 2-second buffer should handle most issues
3. **Stream Quality**: Lower quality streams may perform better
4. **Background Apps**: Close other video apps to free resources

### Format Compatibility
- **HLS (.m3u8)**: ‚úÖ Excellent support with VLC
- **MP4**: ‚úÖ Works with both players
- **FLV**: ‚úÖ Better support with VLC
- **RTSP**: ‚úÖ VLC has better RTSP support
- **WebM**: ‚úÖ Both players support it

- Better performance than standard player

### iOS  
- VLC integrates with iOS video pipeline
- Supports background playback
- Hardware acceleration enabled

### macOS

## üé¨ Recommended Usage

1. **For HLS Streams**: Always use VLC Player (mobile/desktop)
2. **For MP4 Videos**: Either player works well
3. **For Web Testing**: Use provided test URLs
4. **For Production**: VLC Player provides better reliability

## ‚ö° Performance Tips

- Use VLC Player for better HLS stream handling
- Test with provided working URLs first
- Check network connectivity for stream issues
- Use hardware acceleration when available
- Monitor app performance and switch players if needed

The dual-player approach ensures maximum compatibility across all platforms while providing the best possible streaming experience!
