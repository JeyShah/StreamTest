## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (3.19.0 or higher)
- Dart SDK (3.3.0 or higher)
- For Android: Android Studio and Android SDK
- For iOS: Xcode and iOS SDK
- For macOS: Xcode and macOS SDK

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd hls_video_player
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
flutter pub get
```

3. Run the app:
```bash
# For web
flutter run -d chrome

# For Android (with device/emulator connected)
flutter run -d android

# For iOS (with device/simulator connected)
flutter run -d ios

# For macOS
flutter run -d macos
```

### Building for Production

#### Web
```bash
flutter build web
```
The built web app will be in `build/web/` directory.

#### Android
```bash
flutter build apk --release
# or for app bundle
flutter build appbundle --release
```

#### iOS
```bash
flutter build ios --release
```

#### macOS
```bash
flutter build macos --release
```

## Configuration

### Network Security

The app is configured to allow HTTP traffic for streaming compatibility:

- **Android**: Internet permissions added in `AndroidManifest.xml`
- **iOS/macOS**: `NSAppTransportSecurity` configured to allow arbitrary loads
- **macOS**: Network client entitlements added for sandbox compatibility

### Example Stream URLs

The app comes pre-configured with a working test stream URL and includes several working examples:

**Pre-loaded Test Stream:**
```
https://test-streams.mux.dev/x36xhzz/x36xhzz.m3u8
```

**Additional Working Test URLs (clickable in the app):**
- HLS: `https://test-streams.mux.dev/x36xhzz/x36xhzz.m3u8`
- MP4: `https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4`
- MP4: `https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/Sintel.mp4`

**Important Note:** The URL `https://test-streams.mux.dev/bbb-360p.m3u8` is not working (returns 404). Use the working test URLs provided above.

## Architecture

The app uses:
- **Flutter**: Cross-platform UI framework
- **video_player**: Official Flutter plugin for video playback
- **Material Design 3**: Modern UI components
- **Custom Controls**: Built-in video player controls

### Key Components

- `VideoPlayerScreen`: Main screen with URL input and video player
- `VideoPlayerController`: Handles video playback logic
- Custom UI controls overlaying the video player
- Error handling and loading states

## Chrome Extension Support

To package as a Chrome extension:

1. Build for web:
```bash
flutter build web
```

2. Create a `manifest.json` in the `build/web/` directory:
```json
{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "name": "HLS Video Player",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Cross-platform HLS stream video player",
  "action": {
    "default_popup": "index.html"
  },
  "permissions": ["activeTab"]
}
```

3. Load the `build/web/` directory as an unpacked extension in Chrome.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **CORS Issues (Web)**: Some streams may have CORS restrictions. Consider using a proxy server.

2. **Network Security (iOS/macOS)**: For production apps, configure specific domains instead of allowing all HTTP traffic.

3. **Android Permissions**: Ensure internet permission is added to AndroidManifest.xml.

4. **Video Format Support**: Not all formats are supported on all platforms. Test with common formats like HLS and MP4.

### Performance Tips

- Use HLS streams for better performance and adaptive bitrate
- Consider implementing a loading indicator for better UX
- Handle network connectivity changes gracefully
