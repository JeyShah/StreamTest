- **Host/IP Address**: Your server's IP or domain name
- **Port**: Your server's port number

**Example for a custom server:**
```
Protocol: ws
Host: 192.168.1.100
Port: 8080
Preview: ws://192.168.1.100:8080
```

### 4. Test and Save
- **Test Button**: Tap "Test" to verify connectivity (optional)
- **Save Button**: Tap "Save" to apply the configuration

## 🎯 What You Can Configure

### Protocol Options:
- **WebSocket (ws)**: Unsecured WebSocket connection
- **WebSocket Secure (wss)**: Secured WebSocket connection
- **RTMP**: Real-Time Messaging Protocol
- **HTTP**: Standard HTTP connection
- **HTTPS**: Secure HTTP connection

### Quick Presets:
- **Local:8080**: Sets up `ws://localhost:8080`
- **RTMP:1935**: Sets up `rtmp://localhost:1935`

## 🔧 Features You Get

✅ **Connection Status**: Real-time status indicators  
✅ **SDP Generation**: Creates WebRTC offer for your server  
✅ **ICE Candidates**: Handles connectivity negotiation  

## 📱 Using the App

1. **Grant Permissions**: Allow camera and microphone access
2. **Configure Server**: Set your custom server details
3. **Start Streaming**: Tap "Start Stream" to begin
4. **Monitor Status**: Watch connection status and server info
5. **Control Media**: Use buttons to control audio/video

## 🔍 Debug Information

The app logs detailed information to help with debugging:
- Server connection attempts
- WebRTC SDP offers
- ICE candidates
- Connection state changes

**To view logs:**
- Use `flutter logs` or check your IDE's debug console
- All WebRTC events are logged with `debugPrint`

## 🛠 Technical Details

### Server Integration Points:
1. **SDP Offer**: App generates WebRTC offers that need to be sent to your server
2. **ICE Candidates**: Connectivity information that should be exchanged
3. **Media Stream**: Local camera/audio stream ready for transmission
4. **Connection Events**: Real-time status updates for your server integration

### What Happens When You Stream:
1. App creates RTCPeerConnection with your server configuration
2. Captures local media (camera/microphone)
3. Generates SDP offer for WebRTC negotiation
4. Displays connection status and server URL
5. Provides media controls for testing

## 📋 Next Steps for Integration

To fully integrate with your server, you'll need to:

1. **Implement Signaling**: Handle SDP offer/answer exchange
2. **Process ICE Candidates**: Exchange connectivity information
3. **Handle Media Stream**: Process the incoming WebRTC stream
4. **Add Authentication** (if needed): Implement server authentication
